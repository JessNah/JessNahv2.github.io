                    <p style="line-height:3.2em;">I wish I could say that I was one of those people who was programming since they were a kid and their whole life they knew that their dream was to be a programmer and work with software or to be an engineer.
				I really was not like that, my dream job kept jumping from artist to lawyer to architect to everything else. I had no clue what I wanted to do, my mother was pulling for me to become a doctor, I had the grades. But I had this fear or blood and I just find hospitals and clinics far too depressing for it to be the place that I was headed every day that I got up in the morning. My dad was a civil engineer and watching him, made me want to become an engineer, I wasn't sure what type. But an Engineer sounded fun and challenging - after all, aren't engineers like the modern version of mad scientists? I mean really, think about it.  
				</br></br>
				When I applied to different universities, most required that I apply to a specific discipline of engineering, and I had no idea what I wanted. In highschool, you really don't learn enough to make this huge decision that would impact literally the rest of your life. Anyway, since I had to pick, I applied to the electrical and chemical engineering disciplines most often.
				</br></br>
				So, I ended up choosing Queen's University, not only because it was a renowned and beautiful University but also because, it offered a general first year, which was just perfect for me. It let me sample a bit of all the different engineering disciplines in my first year before having to make my pick.
				</br></br>
				And then it happened, I fell in love with C in my first year programming course. For my term group project, I did all the work, quite literally, my partner basically just showed up for the presentation. And I did not resent him for it in the slightest. To be very honest, I was quite happy that he just let me do it. Because I loved it, I didn't know how much I'd love it in the start. It just started off with me just making the outline archetecture for the code to get us started, and then I just could not stop coding. I loved every minute of it. Enough, to choose computer engineering when it came time for discipline selection. Now, i still wasn't convinced, I mean just because I loved Matlab and C in first year, does not mean that I was going to love the whole load that came with computer engineering. But I chose it anyway because at Queen's computer engineering and electrical engineering were tied quite closely together as they came under the same department: ECE and that made switching between the two discplines not too difficult as alot of the courses could end up counting as electives for the other discipline. So, I knew that even if computer engineering wasn't everything I had hoped and dreamed. I always had electrical which had been one of the engineering disciplines I had applied to at the very start. But I loved it, I loved every inch of what it mean to be a computer engineer (Maybe I'm lying a little, some of the hardware stuff wasn't the absolute funnest, I'm definitely more of a software girl - But I did still love it.)
				</br></br>
				My whole life I've been someone who loves learning things for fun in my spare time, I remember making long elaborate flash animations, my whole passion for digital art was self taught, and computer engineering and the world of software development really just takes my passion for learning and creating that I have had my whole life and its turned it into my career. Honestly, I could not be more lucky. In my spare time, I'm always learning new things, from trying to get better at angular web development and learning better database skills to creating mobile apps and lately, I've been very much into google's new daydream VR.
				</br></br>
				I love what I do.
